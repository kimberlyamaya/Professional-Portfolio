**About Me**

My name is Kimberly Amaya and I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UC Davis. I am currently
working in the IT dept of a 3rd party logictics warehouse. We have a home grown Warehouse Management System
that our accounts run on with in-house programmers. Over the years I've been exposed to coding, SQL, APIs, 
version control softwares, lots of testing, implementation projects and lots more. Scratching the surface
of coding sparked my interest and I am hooked. It is truly magical.
